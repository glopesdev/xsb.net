Changes required to XSB source in order to compile XSB
(under Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition):
------------------------------------------------------

1. In file context.h:

Comment out the <windows.h> and <sql.h> includes.
Usually these are after line 128, with the following form:

//BELOW INCLUDES ARE FOR SQL Interfaces
#ifdef CYGWIN
#define FAR
#include "sql.h"
#else
#ifdef WIN_NT
//#include <windows.h>
//#include <sql.h>
#endif
#endif
//end of SQL related includes.

2. In cinterf.h:

Comment out the redefinition of string_find. It somehow differs from
previous declarations.
